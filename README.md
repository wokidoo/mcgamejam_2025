- Make the game short and addicting.

- Make game short and sweet, modular design to add more content to the game.

- Creating simple systems and mechanics. Make sure all tools and systems are implemented modularly.

- Agree to be at the opening and closing ceremony.

- Avoid two people working on the same content.

- To import godot assets: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/assets_pipeline/import_process.html

- Making character concept art, designs in photoshop, then remake the designs and animations in adobe animate.

- Sprite sheet animation, visual development library with model sheets to maintain consistency.

- Two different art styles could be nice to differentiate different things. Unsure yet will decide later.
